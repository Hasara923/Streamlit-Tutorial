# Streamlit-Tutorial
Breast Cancer Prediction Web App
This is a Streamlit web application that performs data analysis and prediction on a Breast Cancer dataset. The app allows users to explore the dataset, view statistical summaries, visualize data, and predict the type of breast cancer based on user input.

Features

Data Exploration:

Display the shape of the dataset.
View tabular data of the Breast Cancer dataset.
Display statistical summaries.
Visualize correlations using a heatmap.
Generate different types of graphs, including scatter plots, bar graphs, and histograms.

Breast Cancer Prediction:

Train a Logistic Regression model on the dataset.
Display model accuracy and classification report.
Allow users to input features and predict whether the breast cancer is Malignant or Benign.
